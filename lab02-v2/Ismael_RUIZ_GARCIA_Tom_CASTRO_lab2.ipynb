Notice how we are not specifying the id column, since that will be autogenerated by the DB. Caveat: once you have loaded the data, double check that the id/SERIAL column starts at 1. \n",

    "4. Look at the hours per week of people with a paying job, by sex. Look at how many's income is above and below 50k. Compare and analyse. - Note: no need to elaborate, produce a single table that shows the data for both sex and salary.\n",
    "5. How many people with college education do manual labour?\n",
