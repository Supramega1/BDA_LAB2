    "\n",
    "2. Load the datasets. We should use this version of the copy_from command where we specify the name of the columns and the value for NULL in the file of origin. Notice how we are not specifying the id column, since that will be autogenerated by the DB. Caveat: once you have loaded the data, double check that the id/SERIAL column starts at 1. \n",

    "4. Look at the hours per week of people with a paying job, by sex. Look at how many's income is above and below 50k. Compare and analyse. - Note: no need to elaborate, produce a single table that shows the data for both sex and salary.\n",
    "5. How many people with college education do manual labour?\n",
